# CO2_and_ForeignExchange_Rate-Task2
## Note: Though in the task I was asked to print date of successful-execution only once I actually printed twice seperately for CO2 cycle and FX Rate as the successful-execution dates are different for them(Also the FX Rate website is giving the rate till 10-March,2022 even though I worked on it on 18-Feb,2022)
