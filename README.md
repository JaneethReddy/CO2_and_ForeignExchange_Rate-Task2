# CO2_and_ForeignExchange_Rate-Task2
## Note: Though in the task I was asked to print date of successful-execution only once I actually printed twice seperately for CO@ cycle and FX Rate as they both are different(Also the FX Rate website is giving the rate till 10-March,2022 even though I worked on it on 18-Feb,2022)
